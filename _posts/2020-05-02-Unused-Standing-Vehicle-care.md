Our world right now is in a paused state, most of the countries are under some form of lockdown brought upon by the Corona Virus COVID-19 which emegred from Wuhan, China in 2019.

Any machine if not used regularly undergoes some sort of decay or degradation in performance. This is also true for our vehicles which are nothing but a combination of multiple systems. Lets look at the different components which we need to take special care off when our vehciles are not in use everyday.

## TLDR:
The proper functioning of a car will depend on the below 6 areas, dependeing on a car's make/model and age, each car will definetly experince some form degradation in the belwo mentioned 6 areas.

**A moving car is a happy car**, if you can do a 5 min drive of your car like I am suggesting below, **once a week for petrol and twice a week for diesel engine** you dont have to worry about a thing.

Otherwise keep an watch for the below 6 common problems.


## 1. Starting your car.

Starting your car is a combination of multiple things, but this is a good step to begin and find if there are any issues. **Start your car atleast once a week for Petrol and twice a week for Diesel.**

While starting your unused car we need to have some additional steps, conside this as a checklist,

- First even before starting, check underside of car for any leakages around engine bay, fuel tanks and wheels.
- First pur your key into ignition, but dont start the engine.
- Check for any warning lights on the dashboards,
- Wait for a good 1-2 minutes for all fluids, oils, to circulate all systems to atleast undergo some sort of start up.
- During this wait, you can open your hood, check if any wires have been damaged due to rodents or environmental conditions.
- When all is good, get back into the car, open all windows, if automatic windows, then dont open windows (this will draw power from battery), just keep your driver door open for now.
- Remove all brakes and parking breaks,
- Keep your car in neutral (No gear).
- Turn off all power drawing features of your car, climate control and AC, automatic hedlights, car interrior lights, USB chargers etc.
- **Then start your car in neutral, again wait for good 2-3 min before putting it in gear.**
- If all good, then close the car door. :)


## 2. Battery Care.

The most important component needed to start a car's engine is battery. Most car batteries are ~12V in standstill and ~14V-14.5V under running conditions. Dry cell battery have a lower rate of discharage (they are also called as maintainence free batteries). Wet cell battery needs water level top up regularly also discarges quicker.

**There is another facet, Diesel cars need a higher voltage to start that petrol cars due to more filters and pumps needed by a diesel engine.**

To take care of your battery,
- Inspect car battery terminals regularly for any accumulated carbon and ensure the contacts are contaminents free.
- If you have a dry cell battery, there is not much to do except above point.
- If you have a multimeter, you can check for any voltage drop at regular intervals.
- For wet cell battery, inspect the water levels and if needed top them up.
- If your car doesnt start, most likely the battery is discharged. In such cases don't keep starting the car, you will damage the starter motors.
- You need a spare battery to jump start your car so that your discharged battery can be charged back.
- Some people also advice to disconenct the battery completely.
- However disconnecting car battery is a very extreme step, and is done in some very exceptional cases, this should not be done unless consulted with a mechanic. Dont attempt it if never done before, you run risk of causing short circuit in your car.

## 3. Climate control and Air conditining.

There is not much that goes wrong in your air conditioning system, unless there is a leak in the condensor pipes. The only problem that can happen here is bugs, spiders will take refuge in the air vents and make it their home, also causing a bad smell.

It is advisable to not directly start using air conditioning and climate control in a car which is standing still. As advised in the starting your car section, start your car with everything turned off. Once the car is moving at above 20-30 kmph, start by opening the air vents of your air conditining unit to take fresh air in, you should have already lowered all your windows by now. Let enough fresh air circulation to happen, you can also start your AC in fan mode and keep the fan blower at full speed to ensure all bugs and bad smell is flushed out from the vents.

Once you do the above for good 2-3 min, only then close air vents, close windows and start your AC. Dont try this in a stand still car, your radiator will heat quickly, especially if fluids are low and no fresh air is hitting the radiator.

## 4. Tyres.

When car's tyres sit in one spot for a long period of time, they develop flat spots and deformation. Especially in extreme cold and heat conditions. However this wont happen if we are talking of some weeks or even few months it is not an issue. This typically happens in the time frame of 3-4 months.

Best way to avoid any such issues, is to roll your car few meter forwards and backwards every week. If you can start your car and move it for 500m forwarad and backward then even better. A good excerise is to change the parking spot of your car every week, this would indirectly take care of everything.

## 5. Brakes & wheel hubs.

When a car is not in use, car brakes, callipers, suspension springs, bearings, hubs all get stuck at one place and thier contact points dry up. You will defiently hear this noise if you start a car after couple of weeks.

Hence it is advisable to not overspeed in a car which has been idle for a long time. **Best to take it slow, apply brakes slowly, move steering slowly and feel if everything is working fine and keep ears open for any noise,** Springs, bearings hubs get in shape quickly (within first 1km) as the grease and oils start to coat all surfaces again.

Brake & brake callipers need some time to get upto optimal performance. So smooth application of brakes for first 8-10km is must, this will ensure the friction remove any rust and contaminents sitting in between brake discs and callipers and they work optimally for you.

## 6. Hand brake or parking brake.

**NEVER USE HAND BRAKE TO PARK A CAR if you cant drive your car regularly.** Handbrake is physical braking system unlike car brakes which are a fluid based system. Handbrake is a cable to each wheel hub which stops it from rotating. If the hand brake is kept applied for long time, these cables get rigid and can snap or get stuck. So even if you remove hand brake from inside your car, the car wheel is still under braking tension as cable is stuck.

Solution is very simple, **if your car is parked on a flat surface**, just put the car in gear and park it. If you want to feel extra safe, keep a stone or wheel wedge in front.

**If your car is parked on a slope**, do the same, put the car in gear, and in this case the stone or wheel wedge is a must.

Stay safe!

Happy Driving!
