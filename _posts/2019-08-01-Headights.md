Aah, I wanted to write about this for so long, only if I had a nickle everytime I have cursed when I see a noob driving towards me with white headlamps on high beam. Apart from the safety aspect aside of this situation, the main problem I realized after talking to many after market car parts vendors is the lack of knowledge about what is best for a vehicle. The over saturation of cheap LED headlamps also doesnt help.

So as part of this Know your car series, lets start with a very basic, something that is visible, easily accessible to everyone, your car's eyes, Headlights.

Headlights have been part of cars since there was a car, even before cars, horse drawn carraiges used to hav e oil lamps in a crystal housing to illumate the surrondings.

# The Fundamentals

There are certain terms we need to understand, contrary to popular belief, all headlights are not same. A headlight assembly is a combination of,
- Housing (Reflector/Projector)
- Light Source (Halogen/LED/HID/Laser)
- Color (Temprature)
- Throw (Distance of road illuminated from the bumper of the car)
- Brightness (Lumens)
- Headlight Bulb mount. (HB/H number)

Lets talk about each of them.

# Headlight Housing

## Reflector housing

The most common headlight housing is the reflector housing. It is a very simple and for car manufacturers very straightforward setup to keep the price of the car down. Hence you see this on 99% of the cars on the road. The idea is simple, it has a Halogen light bulb creating light, which bounces of the reflective mirror surface at the back and comes out of the clear glass at the front.

This is a battle tested headlight design. This has been the headlight design used for pretty much every vehcile invented by man, be it on land, water, air and even space.

### Advantages:
- Low Cost
- Easy maintainence

### Disadvantages:
- High percentage of light wasted as heat.
- High percentage of light scattered above road surface.
- Only compatible with halogen bulbs.
- Less throw.


## Projector housing

With advances in motorsports which is the testing ground for car manufacturers, projector headlamps eventually found their way to high end European sports cars. Then slowly trickled down to consumer cars.

The idea of a projector housing is similar, with the change being it has a lens in front to project the light on the road. Compared to reflectors, manufacturers take more care for sealing the housing for dust, debris and water. As it is very difficult to clean a projector housing, more often than not in case of a breach in a seal, you will have to replace the housing.

### Advantages:
- 0 scatter above the road.
- More throw.
- Less wattage bulbs in projectors produce same light as high wattage bulbs in reflectors.
- Less heat.
- Supports LED, HID headlights.

### Disadvantages:
- Expensive compared to reflectors.
- Needs car for dust and water protection.

# Light Source, Brightness & color.

Now we come to the meat of this topic. Why people seem to have an obsession with white light and how are they able to get white light of reflectors only support halogens.

First of all people, people seem to forget that these three are separate topics, but as this is how majority of the audience sees this, lets address all of them together and understand why we often mix them.

Lets start with the simplest,

## Color

The color temprature scale above shows the range of light and how different temprature correspond to color.

At the lower end of the scale, from 2000K to 3000K, the light produced is warmer, while the mid range is more of a neutral zone, where it is neither the greenish yellow you know, but neither it is pure white. Above 4500K brings us into the 'daylight' color temperature of light. Light bulbs with color temperatures of 4500K and above will give off a blue-white light.

> The reason the standard greenish yellow headlight is most common is because it is the most battle tested color, green shades are more soothing & less tiring to the eyes at night, they are able to better penetrate weather conditions like fog, rain, clouds. The jury is still out on white color doing the same, especially during rains at night.

## Brightness

The brightness is something very simple and non technical to understand, brightness is what defines how much you see on the road at night. Even though you measure brightness in Lumens, it is very rarely advertised on the package as such. The main reason being, as said above it will depend on what enviroment you measure the light. If it is foggy, clear, raining, snowing will have a say on how much light produced by your headlights actually hits the road. Hence typically, headlights are advertised by their power rating. A standard for cars is to have a 55/60 W. So the most obvious path towards upgrade is to UP the wattage and have a 100/90 W bulb instead. This does solve the problem of producing more light, but it also amplifies the disadvantage. (Heat, Light waste, etc)

Notice we havent talked about color, that is because brightness and color is not same. A yellow bulb can be as bright as a white one.

> When most people want to upgrade headlights, they actually want more brightness and not necessarily change color. But because of lack of knowledge, a common misconception is white color is more bright and the whole problem starts.

## Light Source

> The most common misconception is that you need to change your bulb type to change headlight color.

### Halogen bulb

Any halogen bulb, has a tungsten filament which burns when current passes through it. The glass housing for this filament is filled with a inert gas with small traces of Halogens like Bromine or Iodine. This bulb produces the greenish yellow light that we are used to.

You can spend a bit more and get a halogen bulb that produces a more neutral light, something like 3700K - 3900K which is much more on the whiter side. The way this is achived is the halogen around the filament is Xenon, which burns brighter and produces a whiter light. Search for Philips Nightvision, Osram Night Breaker series.

### LED

Other light source which has gained popularity due to lets face it the cheap cost is LEDs. LED light source has some particular quirks which are not obvious,
- The filament does not get hot, but the driver part (the base) does, so you need a cooling fan at the base.
- As it is LED even a 30-35W LED, produces same light as a 55W Halogen.
- Low life span than Halogen, particular if it is not from OEM.
- Due to the additional cooling requirement, the manufacturer needs to plan for this while desiging the car. Hence more often than not, even though you can fit LED in your housing, it messes up with headling assembly due to the heat produced at the base.
- Works better in projector housing than in reflector.

### HID / LASERS

While HID is started to trickle down to consumer Cars, Lasers are still exclusive to very high end consumer or sports cars. HID also produces a whiter light which is also brighter. HID is High intensity discharge, produced by lamps which have high saturation of gas like Xenon. Some quriks of HID / LASER,
- Can be fitted in projectors only.
- Need a heat sink bolted on to the car to disperse the heat, which is even more than LEDs.
- So again similar to LEDs, if your manufacturer hasnt planned for it, doing this after market is really risky.
