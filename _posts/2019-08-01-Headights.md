I wanted to write about this for so long, only if I had a nickle everytime I have cursed when I see a noob driving towards me with white headlamps on high beam. Apart from the safety aspect aside of this situation, the main problem I realized after talking to many after market car parts vendors is the lack of knowledge about what is best for a vehicle. The over saturation of cheap LED headlamps also doesnt help.

So as part of this "Know Your Car" series, lets start with a very basic component, something that is visible, easily accessible to everyone, your car's eyes, Headlights.

Headlights have been part of cars since there was a car, even before cars, horse drawn carraiges used to have oil lamps in a crystal housing to illumate the surrondings.

## The Fundamentals

There are certain terms we need to understand, contrary to popular belief, all headlights are not same. A headlight assembly is a combination of,
- Housing (Reflector/Projector)
- Light Source (Halogen/LED/HID/Laser)
- Color (Temprature)
- Throw (Distance of road illuminated from the bumper of the car)
- Brightness (Lumens)
- Headlight Bulb mount. (HB/H number)

Lets talk about each of them, and also see what are some of the things every Indian Car Owner should know.

## Facts
1. Any alteration to your headlight assembly as provided by your car manufacturer is illegal as per Indian Motor Vehicle Act.
2. Even swapping out your halogen bulb for plug-to-plug LED/HID Kits is illegal.
3. Moreover you void the manufacturer warranty, a common argument is, "Hey we are not cutting any wires or such, then why is warranty void?". It is because your vehcile's headlight assembly was designed and passed inspection to ensure it meets certain standards of safety, maintainence, etc. If tomorrow due to the higher power requirements of HID or cooling issues of LED, you blow your fuse or damage wires, your manufacturer has complete right to refuse you the warranty.

## Headlight Housing

### Reflector housing
[Picture for reflector housing]

The most common headlight housing is the reflector housing. It is very simple and for car manufacturers, a straightforward setup to keep the price of the car down. Hence you see this on 99% of the cars on the road. The idea is simple, it has a Halogen light bulb creating light, which bounces of the reflective mirror surface at the back and comes out of the clear glass at the front.

This is a battle tested headlight design. This has been the headlight design used for pretty much every vehcile invented by man, be it on land, water, air and even space.

#### Advantages:
- Low Cost
- Easy maintainence

#### Disadvantages:
- High percentage of light wasted as heat.
- High percentage of light scattered above road surface.
- Only compatible with halogen bulbs.
- Less throw.


### Projector housing

Projector headlamps eventually found their way to high end European sports cars. Then slowly trickled down to consumer cars.

The idea of a projector housing it has a lens in front to project the light on the road. This ensures nearly all light is focused towards the road. Having a lens means there is a sharp cutoff between illuminated vs non-illuminated region, hence increasing contrast. If you compare this with reflectors, the light in reflectors will blend in more smoothly with the  non-illuminated region.

Manufacturers have to spend more resources in desiging to ensure proper barriers for preveinting dust, debris and water.

#### Advantages:
- 0 scatter above the road.
- More throw.
- Less wattage bulbs in projectors produce same light as high wattage bulbs in reflectors.
- Less heat.
- Supports LED, HID headlights.

#### Disadvantages:
- Expensive compared to reflectors.

## Light Source, Brightness & color.

Now we come to the meat of this topic! First of all people, people seem to forget that these three are separate topics.

Lets start with the simplest,

### Color

[picture of color temp scale]

At the lower end of the scale, from 2000K to 3000K, the light produced is warmer, while the mid range is more of a neutral zone, where it is neither the greenish-yellow you know, but neither it is pure white. Above 4500K brings us into the 'daylight' color temperature of light. Light bulbs with color temperatures of 4500K and above will give off a blue-white light.

> The reason the standard greenish yellow headlight is most common is because it is the most battle tested color, green shades are more soothing & less tiring to the eyes at night, they are able to better penetrate weather conditions like fog, rain, clouds. The jury is still out on white color doing the same, especially during rains at night.

Recently EU Laws have made it mandatory for car manufacturers to equip lights more towards the white range.

### Brightness

Brightness is what defines how much you see on the road at night. More the brightness more the visibility. Typically, headlights are advertised by their power rating. A standard for cars is to have a 55/60W bulbs. So the cheapest way for most people to UP the brightness is to UP the wattage and have a 100/90W bulb instead. This does solve the problem of producing more light, but it also amplifies the disadvantages. (Heat, Light waste, etc)

Brightness has nothing to do with color, a yellow bulb can be as bright as a white one.

> When most people want to upgrade headlights, they actually want more brightness and not necessarily change color. But because of lack of knowledge, a common misconception is white color is more bright and the whole problem starts.

### Light Source

#### Halogen bulb

Any halogen bulb, has a tungsten filament which burns when current passes through it. The glass housing for this filament is filled with a inert gas with small traces of Halogens like Bromine or Iodine. This bulb produces the greenish yellow light that we are used to.

You can spend a bit more and get a halogen bulb that produces a more neutral light (3700K - 3900K) but still consumes same power. This is possible due to higher concentration of Xenon along with Halogens.

#### LED

Other light source which has gained popularity due to its cheap cost is LEDs. LED light source has some particular quirks which are not obvious,

- The filament does not get hot, but the driver part (the base) does, so you need a cooling fan at the base.
- Even a 30-35W LED, produces same light as a 55W Halogen.
- You can get LED in any color, not just white.
- LED have low life span than Halogens, especially the cheap Chinese ones.
- Due to the additional cooling requirement, the manufacturer needs to plan for this while desiging the car. Hence more often than not, you will need some kind of fan or cooling to disperse heat.
- Works better in projector housing than in reflector.

#### HID / LASERS

While HID technology for headlights has started to trickle down to consumer Cars, Lasers are still exclusive to very high end consumer or sports cars. HID produces a whiter & brighter light than Halogens and LED. HID is High intensity discharge, produced by lamps which have high saturation of gases like Xenon.

Some quriks of HID,
- Can be fitted in projectors only.
- Need a heat sink bolted on to the car to disperse the heat. Heat generation is more than LEDs & Halogens.
- So again similar to LEDs, if your manufacturer hasnt planned for it, doing this after market is really risky.
- Unlike halognes & lEDs, has a startup delay of 1 - 1.5s.

## TLDR: Conclusion.

1. Safety is number one priority. So dont do anything that would blind the person driving towards you!
2. Any after market headlight upgrade is ILLEGAL as per Indian Motor Vehicle Act, in simple terms, if you are caught and you have anything other than stock headlight approved by your manufacturer, you are in trouble.
3. Any after market headlight upgrade will also void your warranty, no matter how much the shop wala convinces you that it wont.
4. Check if you have reflector or projector assembly, if you have a reflector assembly, dont go for LEDs, instead find a better Halogen bulb than the stock one.
5. Color, Brightness & Bulb Type are three different things. You can change each without changing the other two.
6. For projectors, you can upgrade to LED or HID, provided you ensure proper cooling and heat dispersion.
7. Beware of cheap chinese LEDs, they will do more harm then good. Especially during monsoons. Instead spend a bit more for LEDs from well known brands with warranty.

Cheers!

Safe Driving!
