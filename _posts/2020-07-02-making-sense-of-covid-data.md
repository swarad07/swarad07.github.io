Making sense of COVID-19 numbers locally, nationally is important when most media sources just keeps scaring everyone using the total numbers as a score. It is important to understand the context behind each and what that number means. I hope this post sheds some light on the same.

## Numbers at High level

We need to understand total number of cases includes Active, Recovered and Deceased. Yes read that again, total number also includes Recovered and Deceased. So every day when we say today there are for X cases, we actually need to check how many are Active cases.

ex: If on any day 1000 are new cases, 400 get recovered, 10 are deceased, then on that day the active cases increased by 1000 - 400  - 10 = 590.

This number matters as it truly reflects what is the stress being put on the healthcare systems in your area.

### Who Reports the numbers?

This is an exercise in coordination between with all approved labs, Taluka administrations, Nagar Palikas, State govts, ICMR and center.

You should by now figured our who reports the numbers for your locality. If not do this now. Your local number matters more than state or Country, as that would give you a true picture of how much precautions you need to take and where.

### Which tests are possible?

#### Molecular based Test (RT PCR/TruNat/CBNAAT)
The test is done for all right now, it detects virus in our throat via a throat swab. Time for report usually under 24hrs.

#### Rapid Antigen Detection Test
This is a newer test, however as per reports the accuracy is less. Time for report usually under 30mins.

#### Antibody testing
Antibody test not only detect if you are positive but also check if you recovered on your own without any medication. Such tests are done at random among the population in many cities across the world, including by India in hotspots so you get to know a true sense of how widespread the impact of infection is.

## Testing Strategy

Some people say why can’t we test everyone, that is a foolish argument, you can’t test all population even if you want to.  Given the incubation period of 14 days, someone who is tested -ve today can test +ve tomorrow due to any reason. So this is a waste of available resources.

Then how to decide whom to test? This is done by a strategy as below,
    1. Test all symptomatic patients & their family (high fever, sore throat, etc, or any other COVID19 symptoms)
    2. Test all high risk contacts of #1 even if asymptomatic. Lets call the 1st and 2nd group of people as *High Risk Individuals or HRI*
    3. Inform contacts of HRI via contact tracing to self quarantine.

Above #1, #2 and #3 are to be followed strictly but this is where issues start to happen. Ensuring #2 and #3 is where everything goes wrong if local administration is not strict.

## Growth Rate (lower is better)

This is India's infection growth rate as of 2nd July 2020.

![Growth Rate](/img/covid/growth-rate.png)

Growth rate simply put is how much days it takes for your "active" cases to double. A higher doubling rate means new patients have to be admitted before earlier patients are getting better hence increasing pressure on healthcare system. Our national doubling rate as per above is 25-30 days which is good.

## Why lockdowns?

Healthcare systems are built on a ~5% basis, you assume at any point in time only 5% of the people will need serious healthcare support. In India this number is highly skewed. Far less hospitals in rural, T3, T4 towns and far more in T1 and T2 cities. Rural facilities are often old, less staff, less stock of supplies vs urban facilities have easy access to stock, staff is more and better qualified. As you develop, the the 5% number keeps getting better.

You cant correct 50-60 yrs worth of Healthcare backlog in weeks, you cant ask invisible infection to stop. So what do you do? Lockdown!

The intention was to gear up, take a stock of supplies, set up tracking, coordination with various bodies, prioritize the resources, etc. Lockdown also meant the virus had less persons to infect hence the growth rate was brought down to a level that was managable by the healthcare system. All states were asked to setup temporary hospitals and beds based on certain projections as per population density, etc.

Check the below projection of what the numbers would have been had there been no lockdown.

**If 7 day doubling it would have been ~3589% higher 2,16,03,269 total cases.**

## Positivity Rate

The most important is positivity rate. This is simply how many tests you do in a day and how many of those are positive. Some also count it as positive per 100 tests. This basically means if the number is low it is a good sign that you are testing all HRI and in control. If this number is high, it means you need to do more tests and much job at tracing HRI so they are quarantined before they infect others.

Maharashtra did 25k tests on 1st July, out of which 5k were positive, which means 1 in 5 tests is positive, which is remarkable. (In a bad way) 20% positivity rate. In Delhi, before the centre took over and increased testing. On 15th June (15 days ago), Delhi did 6k tests and 1.6k positive, so a positivity rate of 26%. Compare this with 1st July, when Delhi did 20K tests out of which 2.2k  are positive, so the rate is 11% still higher than national average of 8% but better than it was 15 days ago. This again goes back to not compromising on HRI and testing everyone who the officials think should be tested. Gujrat was also similar when COVID started but as days went by the situation improved due to better contact tracing efforts.

Check the below image which is a 7 day moving average, you can clearly see which states the curve is dipping (means positivity rate falling), stable or increasing. If it is increasing, testing needs to be increased for HRI.

## Recovery across states.

All India recovery are now more than active.

### Recovered (59.4%) + active (37.6%) + deaths (3%)

![recoveries](/img/covid/recovery.png)

Most states more or less have breached the 50% barrier (Recovery is more than Active) or are hovering around it. Which is great news, but it is hardly time to celebrate until there is a considerable gap between two.

## Unlocks

While Lockdowns are effective they come at a huge cost to Economy, so they are not a permanent solution.

We also need to understand the longer the exposure of a person to a carrier HRI increases the chance of getting infected. Suppose you bump into someone who is positive you necessarily won’t get infected but if you spend prolonged time with that person your chances of getting infected go up.

This is again where identifying HRI matters so much, if they are not allowed to roam free without tests or without the information that a person they know is infected they are risking so many lives.

Real life example: If a HRI goes out to buy groceries in Mumbai in 1km distance, he will pass more people than a T2 or T3 city. Hence going back it is super super important to identify HRI, not only for their own safety but for others as well.


## Precautions

Various studies both national, international have shown that the best defense which is cheap and easy i sto wash hands and wear masks. Personal hygiene and sanitization play a huge role in this disease.

Follow all guidelines as given by the authorities religiously.

Some common sense precautions we take at our home,

1. Wash all veggies properly once brought from outside, if possible soak in salt water for few hours before use or store.
2. Mask and sanitizer bottle is must when going out.
3. No touching of any body or face area when outside.
4. Use sanitizer every time you interact with any object outside (car door, currency, lift buttons, store counter, etc)
5. When coming back home, take all belongings to a dedicated area where they can be left untouched for few hours. Wash your hands, feet, face with soap properly.
6. Wash masks everyday or every use. Have 2-3 spare masks per person so the can be washed regularly.
