My name is Swarad Mokal. I am good at following,

- I am a Software Engineer, currently working with Drupal.
- I am huge fan of Kimi Raikkonen & hence Formula 1.
- I know way too much about cars, I dont know why.
- I like to play Sim Racing games on my PS4.
- I also like to read, but mostly of the fantasy genre, A Song of Ice and Fire and Harry Potter nerd.
- That is not true, I also like to read anything related to the world of Motorsports & Engineering.
- If nothing else I prefer farming and gardening.

Will add more as and when I discover more.
